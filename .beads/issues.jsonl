{"id":"ghostreplay-zwv","title":"Graph model claimed as DAG but chess graphs have cycles","description":"## Problem\n\nThe spec explicitly calls the graph model a **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)**, but chess graphs naturally have cycles.\n\nIn real chess, repetition is common (threefolds, perpetual checks, transpositions that revisit positions), so cycles can appear as soon as the same normalized FEN is re-reached.\n\nWhile a standard chess game moves forward in time (making it seem acyclic), the database stores **Positions (FENs)**. In chess, it is perfectly valid to reach the same position twice (e.g., 1. Nf3 Nf6 2. Ng1 Ng8). If a user has ever practiced a \"draw by repetition\" line, the graph will contain a physical loop (Node A → Node B → Node A).\n\n## Spec Correction Needed\n\nUpdate SPEC.md to:\n1.
